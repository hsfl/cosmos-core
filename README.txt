Welcome to COSMOS 1.0-alpha
============================

COSMOS is the Comprehensive Open-architecture Solution for Mission
Operations System, a software framework with source code for 
space mission operations, simulation and flight software.

For the latest information on COSMOS refer to our website:
http://www.cosmos-project.org/

Quick-start:

1) install the latest Qt version (currently Qt5.4) from 
http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/

2) download the COSMOS-core software directly from
https://bitbucket.org/cosmos/core/get/fb4eefd80ed9.zip

3) go to core/examples/agents and open agent_001.pro 
and agent_002.pro in Qt Creator. Compile and execute
the two programs. The two COSMOS agents will start 
talking to each other.
