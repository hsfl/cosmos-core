# How to create new projects

To use COSMOS for your application (e.g. satellite, ground station, etc.) you will want to create a separate project folder. By default the project folders are located inside your <COSMOS>/src/projects/. Create your specific project folder and use one of the example projects if you want to standardize the structure of your project.

Your project folder strucutre will look like the following:
```
my-project
|_ docs
|_ source
    |_ cmake
    |_ libraries
    |_ programs
    |_ thirdparty    
    |_ ...
```
