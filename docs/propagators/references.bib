abstract = {The realizations of celestial and terrestrial reference systems have grown increasingly accurate in recent years, due to advancements in observational technology. Because of its extremely high precision, implementation of the latest IAU-2000 reference systems may pose numerous challenges for users accustomed to the former systems. This paper reviews the relevant IAU resolutions, presents summary equations, discusses accuracy and timing, examines nomenclature necessary to discuss the new reference systems, and offers recommended practices for implementation. Examples are provided to demonstrate the numerical test results and the precision differences between various implementations.},

abstract = {Using analytical theories known as General Perturbations (GP), the US Space Command maintains databases of artificial satellite orbital elements known as the Space Object Catalog. The GP Catalog may be more familiar to the general public as NORAD or NASA two-line orbital elements. These elements are referenced to an unconventional reference frame based on an approximation to the uniform equinox of date. This frame is rarely discussed in detail because the uncertainty of the GP orbital elements is usually larger than the subtle distinctions between non-standard Catalog frames and the conventional International Astronomical Union (IAU) frames. Advances in computing technology now allow for Space Catalog maintenance using higher accuracy numerical techniques, sometimes called Special Perturbations (SP). The SP Catalog is also maintained with respect to a temporal equinox. However, pending IAU resolutions will formally redefine conventional Earth orientation theory with new models that do not require an equinox. The authors review the fundamentals of the old and new IAU transformations, including the transformation of satellite velocity, and relate the current Space Catalog frames to these conventions. Because the uniform equinox is already uncommon outside the US Space Commands, and because it will be rendered obsolete by upcoming IAU conventions, reliance on the uniform equinox should be phased out for high accuracy applications such as the SP Space Catalog.},

abstract = {Over a quarter century ago, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) released the equations and source code used to predict satellite positions through SpaceTrack Report Number 3 (STR3). Because the DoD's two-line element sets (TLEs) were the only source of orbital data, widely available through NASA, this code became commonplace among users needing accurate results. However, end users made code changes to correct the implementation of the equations and to handle rare cases encountered in operations. These changes migrated into numerous new versions and compiled programs outside the DoD. Changes made to the original STR3 code have not been released in a comprehensive form to the public, so the code available to the public no longer matches the code used by DoD to produce the TLEs. Fortunately, independent efforts, technical papers, and source code enabled us to synthesize a non-proprietary version which we believe is up-to-date and accurate. This paper provides source code, test cases, results, and analysis of a version of SGP4 theory designed to be highly compatible with recent DoD versions.},

@article{Capitaine2003,
abstract = {A new precession-nutation model for the Celestial Intermediate Pole (CIP) was adopted by the IAU in 2000 (Resolution B1.6). The model, designated IAU 2000A, includes a nutation series for a non-rigid Earth and corrections for the precession rates in longitude and obliquity. The model also specifies numerical values for the pole offsets at J2000.0 between the mean equatorial frame and the Geocentric Celestial Reference System (GCRS). In this paper, we discuss precession models consistent with IAU 2000A precession-nutation (i.e. MHB 2000, provided by Mathews et al. $\backslash$cite\{Mathews02\}) and we provide a range of expressions that implement them. The final precession model, designated P03, is a possible replacement for the precession component of IAU 2000A, offering improved dynamical consistency and a better basis for future improvement. As a preliminary step, we present our expressions for the currently used precession quantities zetaA, thetaA, zA, in agreement with the MHB corrections to the precession rates, that appear in the IERS Conventions 2000. We then discuss a more sophisticated method for improving the precession model of the equator in order that it be compliant with the IAU 2000A model. In contrast to the first method, which is based on corrections to the t terms of the developments for the precession quantities in longitude and obliquity, this method also uses corrections to their higher degree terms. It is essential that this be used in conjunction with an improved model for the ecliptic precession, which is expected, given the known discrepancies in the IAU 1976 expressions, to contribute in a significant way to these higher degree terms. With this aim in view, we have developed new expressions for the motion of the ecliptic with respect to the fixed ecliptic using the developments from Simon et al. ($\backslash$cite\{Simon94\}) and Williams ($\backslash$cite\{Williams94\}) and with improved constants fitted to the most recent numerical planetary ephemerides. We have then used these new expressions for the ecliptic together with the MHB corrections to precession rates to solve the precession equations for providing new solution for the precession of the equator that is dynamically consistent and compliant with IAU 2000. A number of perturbing effects have first been removed from the MHB estimates in order to get the physical quantities needed in the equations as integration constants. The equations have then been solved in a similar way to Lieske et al. ($\backslash$cite\{Lieske77\}) and Williams ($\backslash$cite\{Williams94\}), based on similar theoretical expressions for the contributions to precession rates, revised by using MHB values. Once improved expressions have been obtained for the precession of the ecliptic and the equator, we discuss the most suitable precession quantities to be considered in order to be based on the minimum number of variables and to be the best adapted to the most recent models and observations. Finally we provide developments for these quantities, denoted the P03 solution, including a revised Sidereal Time expression.},
