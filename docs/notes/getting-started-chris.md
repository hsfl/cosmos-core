=====================================

Disclaimer: This is a "the blind leading the blind" kind of tutorial, so if you're ever very unsure about a topic, please stop tearing your hair out, and go speak with Eric or Miguel.

## COSMOS Basics

### Nodes: 
Physical devices that we can program. Typically, these devices can run 'agents' (we'll get to that in the next header) and contain some sort of computer-like system on them. 
	
	<ex>
		- cell phone
		- gumstix
		- radio
		- computer
		- ground station equipment (GSEs)

### Agents:
Analogous to a data communication assistant.
Code that allow you to interface with physical devices (nodes, sensors, microprocessors).	
	
	<ex>
		There are agents for:
		- talking with IMUs
		- reporting State of Health data
		- communicating with other agents

## C++ Basics

### Classes:
A grouping of functions that contribute to and/or are properties of a specific task or object.
	
	<ex>
		Class:
			- agent
			- math
			- physics
