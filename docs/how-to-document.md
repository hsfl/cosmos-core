# How to document COSMOS {#tutorial-how-to-document}

## Using Doxygen

Download Doxygen from \url{www.doxygen.org} and dox the files that are inside the folder COSMOS/core/documentation/doxygen

## Using Latex

### on Windows

Download Latex from \url{http://www.tug.org/protext/}

Protext will contain MiKTex and TeXstudio.

-extract files to a convenient folder

-The install folder contains a pdf with installation instructions

-follow that document to get TeXstudio up and running. TeXstudio allows you to edit and compile .tex files \\

### Mac OS X

Download the MacTeX distribution from  \url{http://www.tug.org/mactex/}. This contains everything you need, including a complete TeX system with LaTeX. We encourage the use of TexStudio for editing .tex files \url{http://texstudio.sourceforge.net} \\

### Linux

Your Linux system has probably a Latex system working,  otherwise install TeX Live directly. Just install TexStudio from \url{http://texstudio.sourceforge.net}.
