# Install COSMOS on Mac OS X {#install-mac}

The COSMOS software has been tested with Qt5.4 on MacOX 10.10 
with Xcode clang 64bit

We assume (and strongly suggest) that you have the COSMOS folder in 
/Applications/COSMOS/

## Getting Started

1. install the latest Qt version for Mac from 
	http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/

	You should have XCode installed already and clang should 
	be your main compiler by default, if another compiler
	is selected it may have compatibility issues with COSMOS

2. Download COSMOS-core source code
	- using a git client such as SourceTree (recommended) or GitHub for Mac. Using a git client is recommended if you are planning on contributing to the project
	- using the command line
	```
	$ git clone https://<yourusername>@bitbucket.org/cosmos/core.git
	```
3. setup enviromnet variables

To make your life much, much, much easier you should add a couple of
COSMOS environment variables: COSMOSNODES, COSMOSRESOURCES so that when you run the COSMOS programs they will know where the nodes and resources folders are.

To do this create a file 'environment.plist' in */Users/<user>/Library/LaunchAgents*

This file will setup the environment variables automatically when 
you login into your account. No need to start the terminal or 
manually setting the variables.

Put the following xml code into the 'environment.plist' file:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>Label</key>
  <string>my.startup</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>sh</string>
    <string>-c</string>
    <string>
    launchctl setenv COSMOSNODES "/Applications/COSMOS/nodes/"
    launchctl setenv COSMOSRESOURCES "/Applications/COSMOS/resources/"
    </string>

  </array>
  <key>RunAtLoad</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```



Compiling MOST
--------------
1. Open the MOST.pro file in QT Creator
2. On the Target Setup dialog
	- open the details for the Desktop Build
	- Check the Shadow Build
	- Check either the debug or release (or both) configurations
3. IMPORTANT! 
	- Click on the Projects icon (on the left)
	- Build Steps -> Add Build Step -> Make
	- Make Arguments: add 'install'
	- This installs the necessary files to run MOST from the shadow build directory
4. Hit Run!
