# COSMOS core 1.0.2 (beta)

**Please note that the software and its documentation are work in
progress. If you find problems or no documentation for something
you're looking for please let us know.**

The COSMOS/core is the basic element of the COSMOS project with the
essential libraries and programs. The api documentation includes the
descriptions of the basic support functions necessary to make 
COSMOS/core work, as well as the most useful agent and support programs. The
cosmos core is broadly divided into \ref programs and \ref libraries. 
 
If you haven't downloaded or setup the COSMOS software please go to the [COSMOS
101 tutorial](https://bitbucket.org/cosmos-project/tutorial/wiki/Home). Also for the
latest information on COSMOS refer to the website:
[http://www.cosmos-project.org/](http://www.cosmos-project.org/). 
The cosmos-core api documentation is available on
[http://cosmos-project.org/docs/core/current/](http://cosmos-project.org/docs/core/current/) 
with instructions on how to compile the code in different
architectures, the api structure, some tutorials and the description
for most classes and functions. Note: remember to update the code
regularly (git pull). 

Build and install cosmos/core and run two agents that talk to each
other. These instructions assume that you are in the
**cosmos/src/core** folder. Make sure you have all the tools
required to build COSMOS including Cmake (please check the required
setup from
[https://bitbucket.org/cosmos-project/tutorial/wiki/Setup](https://bitbucket.org/cosmos-project/tutorial/wiki/Setup)).

Quick-start:

**1) Using the terminal **

Open a terminal and type

```
#!shell

cd cosmos/src/core/build
cmake ..
make
```

you can make the code compile faster by using multiple cores.
This example shows how to use 8 cores:
```
#!shell

make -j8
```

**2) Using Qt Creator**

* Make sure you are using the latest version of Qt and Start Qt Creator
* Open the CMakeLists.txt file (File -> Open File or Project ->
Open project : cosmos/src/core/CMakeLists.txt)
* Select a build directory (or use the default)
* Optional step to compile the code faster. Please read note 1 if
you're interested. (For Linux check note 2)
* Build the project : ctrl + b
* Check your "cosmos" folder (ex: C:/cosmos) to see the files that
were installed
* Select agent_001. Click on the "Project" button (computer icon on
left side of Qt Creator) and select agent_001
* Run agent_001. Click on the "Run" button (big green icon on left
side of Qt Creator) or press 'ctrl+r'
* Select agent_002. 
* Run agent_002. If running agent_002 stops the run of agent_001 see Note 2. 

The two COSMOS agents should be talking to each other at this point.

Alternatively you can use the cosmos-core.pro file (qmake) or
cosmos-core.qbs (QBS) but these are just experimental build options
for the moment.

* Open Qt Creator and open the project file 'cosmos-core.pro' 
* Configure your project (ex: on Windows it will be something like
'Desktop Qt 5.5.1 MinGW 32 bit')
* Optional step to compile the code faster. Please read note 1 if
interested. (For Linux check note 2)
* Build the project by pressing the "Build" button (hammer icon on
left side of Qt Creator), or press 'ctrl+b'

For more detailed instructions to get started with COSMOS
please read the
[core/docs/README.md](https://bitbucket.org/cosmos-project/core/src/master/docs/)
inside the 
documentation folder.

## Note 1 ##
This is only valid for MinGW and GCC compilers (msvc uses Jom to
handle multiple cores). To compile the code faster using all the cores
on your machine go to Qt Creator -> Projects (icon on left side bar)
-> Build Steps -> Make : Details (expand the icon) on arguments add
"-j4" or whatever number of cores that your computer supports. In some
cases you may have to add a space in between "-j 4". In some cases it
is also possible to just add '-j' and the compiler will automatically
use as many processes it can to compile. This approach works well on
Windows but in Linux it seems to freeze the computer because it starts
more threads than cores. Use it with caution. If you really need super
compilation times then install MSVC 2013 or above. See the results and
make your decision.

## Note 2 ##
Qt creator on Linux and Windows has an option to close the programs automatically
when running another program. You will need to disable this behavior
to run the two agents at the same time. Go to Tools > Options > Build
and Run > General.  Change �Stop applications before building:� to
None.
