COSMOS-core 1.0-alpha
=====================

COSMOS-core is the essence of the Comprehensive Open-architecture Solution for Mission Operations System. 

To get started with COSMOS-core you need to download and configure the COSMOS source code as described in the COSMOS tutorial for developers:
https://bitbucket.org/cosmos/tutorial/

Quick Start:

1) Open Qt creator and load the two example agents: 

- core/examples/agents/agent_001.pro 
- core/examples/agents/agent_002.pro 

Compile and execute the two programs. Start agent_002 first. The two COSMOS agents will start talking to each other.
