Install COSMOS on Mac
=========================

The COSMOS software has been tested with the following
Qt5.4
Mingw 4.9 (and clang 64bit)


Getting Started
--------------
1) install the latest Qt version for Mac from 
http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/

clang should already be your main compiler by default, if another compiler
is selected it may have compatibility issues with COSMOS

2) Download COSMOS-core source code

-- using a git client such as GitHub for Mac.
if you are planning on contributing to the project using a 
client may be the easiest option

-- using the command line
$ git clone https://<yourusername>@bitbucket.org/cosmos/core.git
