Install COSMOS on Windows
=========================

The COSMOS software has been tested with the following
Qt5.4
Mingw 4.9


Getting Started
--------------
1) install the latest Qt version for Windows from 
http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/

select Mingw as your main compiler, you may also choose
to select MSVC as an alternative compiler but there may 
be some compatibility issues with COSMOS

2) Download COSMOS-core source code

-- using a git client such as Tortoise Git for win.
if you are planning on contributing to the project using a 
client may be the easiest alternative

-- using the command line
$ git clone https://<yourusername>@bitbucket.org/cosmos/core.git


MSVC install (optional)
-----------------------
If you really want to use MSVC then follow thes instruction. 
Note: you don't have to use MSVC just to use COSMOS, in fact we
recommend that you use MinGW - the default compiler for Qt on windows.

First install Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 (v12.0), we recommend
Express because it is free and 2013 because is more compliant with C++11. 
Do not use an earlier version of MSVC. The 2015 version will be fully 
compliant with C++11. From this link you can download MSVC 2013 express 
and the Debugging Tools for Windows: 
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/hh852365

If MSVC was correctly installed Qt Creator will automatically detect MSVC and CDB. Make sure you have the msvc2013 64-bit OpenGL version of Qt for 5.4 ( you may check/install this with the MaintenanceTool.exe inside the Qt installation folder (typically C:\Qt). Finally just make sure you have a Qt kit setup for MSVC.
