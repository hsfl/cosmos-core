COSMOS Tutorial: getting started with the concepts of COSMOS
==================================================================
	# What is Cosmos?
Cosmos is a software program that allows the user to manage and create information exchange between many machines.

	# How is this done?
Cosmos uses C-object oriented programming to create the links between nodes.

	# What is a node?
A node is any machine that can collect, send, or receive information. Within these nodes there must exist at least one
agent to perform operations.

	# What is an agent?
An agent is an entity that exists in Cosmos that can do many different things. At the lowest level an agent basically
allows communication to another agent. It could be an agent on the same node or on another node.

	# Why Cosmos?
You might be asking yourself why we would even bother with using Cosmos in the first place. Here are two examples below
that will illustrate how the agents communicate with each other and accomplish the mission objective. The example will
also hopefully give you a better understanding of the concepts of an agent and a node.

# Example 1 : Going to the light

	Mission Objective:
	A moon rover is traveling on the surface of the moon trying to collect rock samples and analyze them. The mission
	is trying to prove the past existence of water on the moon. The device used to analyze the rock however is solar
	powered. If the rover is on the dark side of the moon there is no sunlight to power the rock analyzer. Back at 
	mission control when the
