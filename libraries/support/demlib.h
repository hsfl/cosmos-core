//! DEM (Digital Elevation Model).
//!
//! The COSMOS system integrates Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)for a variety of planetary surfaces.
//! Full globe support at 30 arc sec resolution is available for Earth, Mars, and Moon. Additional higher
//! resolution DEMs of select areas can be added. Additional placeholders are available for other major
//! planetary bodies, as well as targets of opportunity, such as asteroids can be used as the data
//! available.
//!
//! DEMs are stored as floating point numbers in groups of 4; representing altitude in meters, and a
//! Normal (NMAP) in x, y, and z. DEMs for each planetary body are stored at different resolutions, allowing
//! for a minimum of overhead. Only the DEMs required for the desired location and resolution are loaded.
//! Memory use is limited by recycling the oldest accessed DEMs and reclaiming their memory.
//!
//! General usage involves first first opening the DEM system for a given body through ::map_dem_open. This
//! This will return a handle that can be used for all subsequent DEM calls for that body. See \ref demlib_planets
//! for the constants for the various planets. Once a planetary body is open calls to ::map_dem_pixel will return
//! the DEM value for the requested Latitude and Longitude, at the requested resolution.
